# Hi there, I'm Zane üëã

Full-Fledged Generalist advocating DevSecOps within Digital Transformations while gravitating over Cloud(-Native) technologies.

## üöÄ About Me

I am an experienced Chartered Engineer (CEng), Chartered IT Professional (CITP), Solutions Architect, and Consultant with over two decades of experience in software delivery. I specialise in Cloud(-Native) architecture and [CNCF technologies](https://landscape.cncf.io) such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io), and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). My expertise allows me to build resilient, scalable, and portable applications that can run across multi-cloud platforms.

I am proficient in Agile workflows and processes, possess excellent communication skills, and have a critical eye for detail. I can convey knowledge and understanding to all levels of an organisation to deliver successful outcomes. 

I am experienced in digital transformation initiatives, where I help organisations modernise their technology and processes to become more agile, efficient, and competitive in today's digital landscape. Leading initiatives that involve implementing new technologies, processes, and cultural changes across entire organisations, resulting in improved user experiences, better developer productivity and greater stakeholder satisfaction.

My involvement in implementing DevSecOps principle and practices prioritises security within the SDLC, embedding it into every aspect. From Threat Modelling during planning, shifting-left analysis to developer devices using pre-commit hooks, throughout pipelines using SCA, SAST and DAST tooling into environments by continuous scanning and assessment of infrastructure and containers. I also assess [DORA](https://dora.dev) metrics along with others to drive continuous improvement within software deliveries and operational reliability.

I embrace the importance of continuous progressive delivery, pervasive observation and shifting-right testing using feature flags to separate releases from deployments. Monitoring and collecting data across the entire product development, deployment and operational processes into users' browsers to gain insights, improve performance and proactively solve problems before they become issues. By embracing these practices, I can deliver higher quality and more reliable software products.

I have experience with leading cloud providers such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com), and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com), and numerous deployment strategies such as blue-green, canary, and rolling deployments. I am a persistent problem solver, always looking for opportunities to learn and grow, and welcome the chance to collaborate with like-minded professionals in the industry.
